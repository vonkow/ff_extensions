Different Methods of indicating a license in a js file:

StatusNet:
	Goes with the jsDoc style of @tags in comments.
	@category
	@package
	@author (multiple) (format: name <email>)
	@copyright (format: date by)
	@license (format: link license_title)
	@link 

jQuery:
	License info in comments, no tags (comment starts with an !):
		Title
		website
		copyright year, author
		"Dual licensed under the MIT or GPL Version 2 licenses
		license page address

		Includes Sizzle.js
		website
		copyright
		license info, barely

		full date of release

THOUGHTS:
	The jsDoc method of license identification can be parsed pretty easily, and matches the RMS proposed method, this should be supported.
	The jQuery style, while containing the pertinant info, is not easily parsed. Perhaps some primative grepping of license info could occur, but I doubt that passover will have 100% accuracy if it's checking untagged comments.
